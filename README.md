The BeReal for intellectuals.

The Mission

Connecting Friendz through Gemz.

In a world of limitless content -- but limited real connection -- our mission is to connect (highly) curious and independent thinkers to new friendships and networks that they wouldn't have gained access to otherwise.

As the saying goes, "you’re the average of the five people you surround yourself with most.”

...and with the way most of social media currently works (YouTube, Twitter, IG, etc.), it's simply too difficult for you to create these organic networks:

Gemz 💎 fixes this:

By connecting with Friendz through Gemz, you will not only have a ONE place to share all your favorite internet gemz - and store these ideas on your profile for yourself + others to see - but these gemz will also be used to connect you with NEW friends across the 🌎 world!

...so Gemz will become your PERSONALIZED network of

you + your friendz + your gemz.💎
